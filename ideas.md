## Basic Ideas

- 2D simulation software that simulates the lifespan of animals and plants
- 2D terrain generation
- Prey vs. Predators
- Will be able to change attributes that will have a direct impact on the simulation
  - Avg. lifespan of animal1, animal2, animal3, etc.
  - Avg. plant/food growth
  - Avg. offspring rates of each animal
  - Avg. rainfall/water levels
  - Initial animal population
  - Avg. mutability rate of each animal
  - Change the speed of the simulation or go through it step-by-step
  - Graph the current population of each animal type, current amount of food present, current terrain type present
  
## Far-fetched ideas

  - Weather can impact the terrain, and therefore impact the animals and food levels
  - Everything can impact and/or interact with everything 
    - Wolves eat sheep (this is basic functionality)
    - Wolves and foxes can eat each other, or they can gang up with each other 
    - No bees? Then there's no plants!
    - As animals drink water, the terrain is updated to reflect that 
  - Stray humans may wander into the land. Safe to say that they probably won't make it back home...
    - A gang of humans could then come into the land and try to fight the animals 
    - Add tombstone
