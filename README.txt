Welcome to EcoSim!



Project Description:

EcoSim is an application that aims to simulate basic ecosystems. The process starts by generating a randomized terrain. From there, sheep and wolves are placed in the simulation. The user can choose to let the simulation run on its own, resulting in a completely randomized simulation cycle that ends when all animals die. The user also has the choice to modify specific aspects of the simulation, such as the average grass growth rate, starting animal populations, the average amount of water present, and much more. While the simulation runs, a graph conveniently graphs the current population level of each species. Occasionally, random mutations will also appear within an animal, such as appearing twice as large, or maybe even being a different color than expected! The simulation aims to cover a large range of real-world aspects, such as population levels, prey vs. predator, mutations, and much more. 


How to run EcoSim:

1. Download the latest version of Python 3.9 to your computer

2. Unzip the zip file containing the project. Do not move files around within the project directory

3. Open main.py using VScode. By looking at the bottom left-hand corner of the VScode screen, ensure that you are going to be using Python 3.9.* for running the file

4. Run 'main.py'. This should open a new window which will display a title screen for EcoSim

5. Enjoy playing around with EcoSim!


Libraries needed to run EcoSim:

1. Random (this should already be included with Python 3.9)

2. Decimal (this should already be included with Python 3.9)

3. (All libraries needed to run cmu_112_graphics.py, of course, which should all be included with Python 3.9)


Shortcut Commands:

None. To prove that my classes (Animal, Wolf, and Sheep) code, inheritence code, and my health/hunger/thirst code does indeed work and does use classes/inheritence, I have put 12 print statements in timerFired() that shows you that each instance's health/hunger/thirst really is working as I say it is.
